So as per our conversation on call - you will be working with me for front-end development of ThriveIN app that's made to build an online community of creative people and connect them to work with each other.

You will be using Nextjs to build the front-end and also integrate the APIs provided to you.

Design for front-end - <https://www.figma.com/file/O94B2z1vumDZXa1ORKGki4/ThriveIn---Sprint-1?t=EQ87dM9mpszh7iJ8-1>

APIs for front-end integration - <https://thrivein.vangel.is/api>

You will provide me daily updates on tasks using a live link of the project. The timeline that we fixed for this project is strictly 7 days which means that by next Friday (November 25) you will complete the full-project including test with all features working properly.

As per our discussion - I will be adding a few pages related to chat & contacts on Figma within 3-4 days but you have enough to work during this time period.

The price that we fixed for this project is $300 to build the desktop version.

Terms -

1. Full payment will be released via Upwork upon completion of the project + testing.
2. Mobile responsive will be charged additional by freelancer which is not considered as part of this project. The freelancer is only liable to deliver functional front-end for desktop on Nextjs with API integrations.
3. All APIs are to be checked on postman or similar software before accepting the project for smooth delivery.

The freelancer is requested to acknowledge that all points are understood clearly and there is no doubts related to the project, process or timelines. In addition to that, once the client has hired freelancer via Upwork and the freelancer has accepted the offer - he automatically agrees to all terms within this message.

Looking forward to working with you. I hope we are equally satisfied at the end of this project.
